### `Functions, Returns, Calling, and Conditional Statements`
* A function contains variables, values, operators, and parameters.  This allows for organizing code into sections and code reusability.
* like - function lastName(str) {
   Everything inside of these {} curly brackets operates your code. 
  };
* The bundled code in your functions can ONLY run when the functions are called.
* Once it is returned, it evaluates the code and no more lines of code will run.
* You'll get -undefined- if you fail to return the function.
* if - Only run that code if condition is met 
* else if - Run this code if the condition is not met
* else - whatever else
